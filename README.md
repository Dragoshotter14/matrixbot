# matrixbot
### How does it work?
 ● The bot creates instagram accounts through https requests. <br/>
 ● In the first option you can select create account with unique name generating the rest of the characters (automatically generated password), after       selecting the name you need to set the number of accounts you want to create, at the end everything is done. <br/>
 ● Second option the bot will create everything automatically for you, the manual part is for the desired number of accounts to be created <br/>
 ● Third option is just a quick way out, you can use CTRL+C, but the database will not be generated perfectly.
##
Bot developed for learning purposes, but extremely functional.
